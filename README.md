#Cryptocat
#### Browser Instant Messaging Platform with Accessible, Encrypted Messaging
#### Experimental software: Don't trust with your life! Peer review appreciated.

## Description
Cryptocat is a browser-based XMPP client that provides multi-user (and private) instant messaging inside chatrooms. It uses the [OTR](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/) protocol for encrypted two-party chat and the (upcoming) mpOTR protocol for encrypted multi-party chat.  

## Target Platforms
##### Google Chrome: `src/chrome/`
Run `make chrome` to build a Google Chrome-loadable .zip extension (or just .zip the directory.)
##### Mozilla Firefox: `src/firefox/`
Run `make firefox` to build a Mozilla Firefox-loadable .xpi extension (or just .zip the directory and change the extension to .xpi.)
##### Apple Safari: `src/cryptocat.safariplugin/`
Apple's model makes an automated build process difficult.
