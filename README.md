Cryptocat version 2
Barebones codebase!

* There will be no server code since we will be using XMPP for server.
* We will use Strophe.js (http://strophe.im/) for XMPP, available in ext/strophejs
* mpOTR code is in src/common/js
* We will only focus on the Chrome extension until that's done, and then port to other browsers/platforms
* Most of the code here (excluding libraries) will be written from scratch, not from Cryptocat v1

Goals: mpOTR, XMPP, CryptoJS3.
